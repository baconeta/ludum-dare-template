# ludum-dare-template

A template project used primarily for ludum dare gamejams. 

Contains a few preset up functionality and systems, including:

- Basic generic achievement system (uses user prefs for data so is not cheat safe) - possible improvement, add cheat protection.
- Scalable and generic UI composite state switching system with template setups
- Editor tools including ReadOnlyAtrributes for vars in inspector, and struct editing in place for inspector references
- Audio system with mix groups, object pooling and easy volume integration
- A simple template main menu screen
